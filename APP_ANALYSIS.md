## 📊 Core Game Mechanics

### Game State Structure
The app uses a central `GameState` that tracks:
- **graduationProgress**: Progress bar (0-100%), increases with correct decisions
- **currentTaskType**: 'email' | 'password' | 'data-classification'
- **currentEmailId/currentPasswordId/currentDocumentId**: Currently selected task ID
- **investigatedCategories**: Set of email clue categories the user checked (Profile, Link, File, Language, Context, Request)
- **decision**: User's phishing classification ('legitimate' | 'phishing' | null)
- **day**: Current day number (starts at 7)
- **todaysTasksCompleted**: Tasks completed on current day (max 10)
- **dispatchQueue**: Queue of incoming incidents (email, password, or data classification tasks)

### Three Task Types

#### 1. Email Investigation (Primary Task)
- **Component:** `EmailInbox.tsx` + `EmailViewer.tsx` + `InvestigationPanel.tsx`
- **Flow:**
  1. User selects an email from inbox list
  2. Email viewer displays: sender, domain, subject, body, attachments
  3. User investigates 6 clue categories (checkboxes in InvestigationPanel):
     - Profile: Sender email verification
     - Link: URL analysis
     - File: Attachment analysis
     - Language: Grammar/tone analysis
     - Context: Email context validation
     - Request: Type of request analysis
  4. User makes decision: "Phishing" or "Legitimate"
  5. Feedback modal shows:
     - Whether decision was correct
     - Progress reward (1-5% based on investigation thoroughness)
     - Detailed explanation of threat indicators

**Reward System:**
- Correct decision + 50%+ clues investigated = +5%
- Correct decision + some investigation = +2%
- Correct guess (no investigation) = +1%
- Incorrect decision = 0%

#### 2. Password Strength Assessment
- **Component:** `PasswordStrengthTask.tsx` + `PasswordFeedbackModal.tsx`
- **Password Characteristics Checked:**
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Character diversity (upper, lower, numbers, symbols)
  - Dictionary words (red flag)
  - Sequential numbers (red flag)
  - Keyboard patterns (red flag)
  - Personal information
  - Company name
  - Known leaked passwords

**User Decision:** 'approve' | 'revision' | 'reject'
- Correct decision = +5%
- Each password has correct answer stored in mock data

#### 3. Data Classification
- **Component:** `DataClassificationTask.tsx` + `DataClassificationFeedbackModal.tsx`
- **Classification Levels:**
  - **Public**: Can be shared externally
  - **Internal**: Company-only but not sensitive
  - **Confidential**: Board-level/executive info
  - **Restricted**: PII, API keys, customer data

**User Decision:** Classify document into one of 4 categories
- Correct classification = +5%

## 🔄 Data Flow & Game Loop

### Initialization
1. `page.tsx` mounts with initial `GameState`:
   - graduationProgress: 35%
   - currentTaskType: 'email'
   - currentEmailId: 'email-1'
   - day: 7
   - tasksCompleted: 0

2. Time updates every minute (client-side only)

3. Incident generation timer starts:
   - Every 3-10 seconds, generates random incident
   - Adds to `dispatchQueue`
   - Plays notification sound
   - Max 10 tasks/day

### Email Task Flow
1. User selects email from inbox
2. Investigates clues (checkboxes update `investigatedCategories`)
3. Clicks "Make Decision" button
4. `DecisionModal` appears for confirmation
5. User confirms → `handleMakeDecision()` called
6. Progress calculated based on correctness + investigation
7. `FeedbackModal` shows results + explanation
8. User clicks continue → email removed from active list
9. `todaysTasksCompleted` incremented
10. Next email auto-selected

### Password Task Flow
1. Similar to email but simpler
2. User checks password characteristics
3. Makes decision (approve/revision/reject)
4. Feedback modal shows explanation
5. Moves to next password (cycles)

### Data Classification Flow
1. User views document preview + sensitivity indicators
2. Selects classification (public/internal/confidential/restricted)
3. Feedback modal shows explanation
4. Moves to next document (cycles)

### End Day Flow
1. User clicks "End Day" button on desk UI
2. `handleEndDay()` resets daily state:
   - Increments day
   - Resets todaysTasksCompleted to 0
   - Clears dispatchQueue
   - Resets currentTaskIds to first of each type
   - **Preserves** graduationProgress
3. Active emails refreshed
4. Investigation list cleared

## 🐛 Known Issues & Technical Debt

1. **Large page.tsx file**: 1000+ lines of game logic should be split into custom hooks (`useGameState`, `useEmailTask`, etc.)

2. **Next Build Errors**: `next.config.mjs` has `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors: true` - suggests TypeScript issues not resolved

3. **Unoptimized Images**: `images.unoptimized: true` in config

4. **Unused Component**: `EmployeeHandbook.tsx` component is rendered but commented out in page.tsx

5. **Mock Data Only**: No backend - all data is client-side mock data

6. **No Persistence**: Game progress not saved (resets on refresh)

7. **Limited Responsive Design**: Designed for desktop, may have layout issues on mobile

8. **Accessibility**: Could use more semantic HTML and ARIA labels

npm run lint       # Run ESLint
```

### Key Behaviors
1. **Incident Generation**: Every 3-10 seconds until 10 tasks/day completed
2. **Time Display**: Updates every minute (DAY XX • HH:MM AM)
3. **Notification Sound**: Web Audio API sine wave (800Hz, 0.2s)

## 📋 Summary

Sentricol is a well-structured, **client-side only** cybersecurity training game built with modern React/Next.js. It successfully gamifies three core security skills: phishing detection, password policy enforcement, and data classification. The app uses a centralized game state in the main page component and mock data for all scenarios. While functional and visually cohesive, it could benefit from component extraction, backend integration for persistence, and improved accessibility.
